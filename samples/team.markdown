Each Bio should be 3-4 sentences long including these two sections:

They should start with:

* "X Y" is the "role" for this book. E.g. "Filip is the FPE for this book."
* End on a "funny" or "cool" note about hobbies, interests or something fun. E.g. "In his spare time, Filip enjoys bouldering and video games - all the nerdy stuff!"

Headshots should be a good, well lit picture of the team member's face that clearly shows what the team member looks like.

## Examples

Use the bio below from Denis as an example:

**Denis Buketa** is an author of this book. He's an Android developer who always tries to learn new things and get out of his comfort zone.
