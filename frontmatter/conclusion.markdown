# Conclusion

[TODO: FPE: Please add concluding comments from the team and a thank you from the reader. Feel free to also treat this as a sort or "Where to Go From Here?" and direct the reader to other helpful resources on our site to help them deepen their understanding. See EXAMPLE below.]

EXAMPLE: 

What a journey it’s been! From exploring why architecture matters to diving deep into dependency injection, to comparing different architecture patterns, you’ve gotten a taste of architecting iOS apps using advanced techniques and patterns. 

By putting the book concepts to practice, your codebase will become easier to work in and you’ll have more fun writing code. Not only that, you’ll be able to respond quickly to changing requirements.

We hope the ideas you saw in this book inspire you to explore and try out different architecture practices and maybe even inspire you to come up with some of your own! 

If you’re hungry for more architecture related books we recommend reading _Design Patterns by Tutorials_. Also, if you found some of the RxSwift code hard to follow, we recommend checking out _RxSwift: Reactive Programming with Swift_.
