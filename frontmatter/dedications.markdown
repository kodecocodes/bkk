# Dedications

[TODO: FPE - Add Author dedications here for each author. Dedications are usually 3-5 sentences where authors thank their family & friends, loved ones and finally the raywenderlich.com team. Make sure to add the author's name after each dedication. Use the dedication below as an example.]

## Example

"To my family and friends. Thank you for supporting me and being patient as I worked on this book. I’ve told you “no” so many times when you called me to hang out, but you never made me feel guilty about it. Many thanks to the team at [raywenderlich.com](http://raywenderlich.com/), my co-author, the editors and everyone involved in this book. You’ve been a great support and I’ve enjoyed working with you."
